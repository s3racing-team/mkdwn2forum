# mkdwn2forum

A tool for converting markdown files to some strange forum syntax.

## Web page
The web page is automatically deployed [here](https://s3racing-team.github.io/mkdwn2forum/) using github pages.

## CLI
The cli will either read a file path from the first argument passed to it,
or if that isn't present, will try to read from `stdin`.
